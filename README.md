### Compiling the Mod

To compile WeaponLib, follow the steps!
  1) Install Java 1.8 JDK. Verify you're running it in console using `java -version`.
  2) Clone the repository.
  3) Open terminal in the folder where you cloned the repository.
  4) Run `./gradlew build`.
  5) Wait for it to finish executing and open it in your IDE!
  
I have only tested it with IntelliJ. I don't know if this works on Eclipse as well, you may need to modify the build.gradle file a bit more.
